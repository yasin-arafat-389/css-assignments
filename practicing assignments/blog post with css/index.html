        <p>Independent came out with a sweet brand car. Car filled confectionery national food. But he does not have a
            movement pass or any permit from the authorities. Can't even get the higher authority on the phone. Quite
            worried, Swadhin said, 'What am I going to do with this car now!' The incident took place at the SAARC
            Fountain junction in the capital's Karwan Bazar. There are police checkposts at various corners to control
            the movement of people. Police were seen to be a bit strict on the movement without any reason.</p>
        <p>An all-out lockdown has been announced from Wednesday to April 21. The previous lockdown was lax and law
            enforcement was not seen in a tough position to control the movement of people. But this time it was said
            from the beginning, it will be strictly controlled. The movement pass issued by the police to get out in
            case of emergency can be used for a certain period of time.</p>

        <p>Egypt seizes Panama-flagged ship stranded in Suez Canal An Egyptian court has fined the ship's owner 900
            million in damages for blocking important waterways and depriving the country of revenue. If this money is
            not paid, the ship weighing two lakh tons will not be returned. Suez Canal authorities reported the matter
            on Wednesday. Indian media reported on NDTV.</p>
        <p>Last month, the ship 'Ever Given' got stuck almost horizontally. The Suez Canal was closed to traffic. The
            two entrances to the Suez Canal are congested. The container ship was able to move after about a week of
            continuous efforts through various integrated techniques. As a result, the Suez Canal was reopened.</p>

        <h2>Shah Rukh Khan apologized on behalf of Shakib</h2>
        <img src="assets/img/post6.jpg" alt="">
        <p>When Shakib Al Hasan was dismissed for 9 off 9 balls, the chances of Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) winning were
            much higher. Kolkata still needs 31 runs from 28 balls, what else in the era of T20! He still has five
            wickets in hand, two of which are Dinesh Karthik and Andre Russell.</p>
        <P>But Kolkata lost the match against Mumbai Indians incredibly even from such an equation yesterday! In
            Chennai, Kolkata managed to reach 142 for 6 after reaching the target of 152 runs given by Mumbai. This way
            the match is lost!</P>
