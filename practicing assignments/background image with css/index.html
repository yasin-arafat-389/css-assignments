        <p>Assassin's Creed is an open-world action-adventure stealth video game franchise published by Ubisoft and
            developed mainly by its studio Ubisoft Montreal using the game engine Anvil and its more advanced
            derivatives. Created by Patrice Désilets, Jade Raymond, and Corey May, the Assassin's Creed series depicts a
            fictional millennia-old struggle between the Assassins, who fight for peace with free will, and the
            Templars, who desire peace through order and control.</p>
